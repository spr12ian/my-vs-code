Enable VS Code Settings Sync (Convenient Cloud Backup)
This ensures quick syncing across devices using your GitHub or Microsoft account.

Steps:
Open VS Code.

Click ⚙️ (bottom left) → "Turn on Settings Sync...".

Sign in with GitHub (recommended for your developer workflow and since this file started on GitHub).

Choose what to sync (ensure "Extensions" and "Settings" are selected).

Repeat on all systems — it’ll auto-sync once signed in.
